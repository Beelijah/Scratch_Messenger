# Who are you?

I am the creator of games like [Super Millie Brothers](https://turbowarp.org/1103517382?interpolate), [Henry Stickmin Scratch Port](https://turbowarp.org/1112506899), and of course, Scratch Messenger.
I own the YouTube channel [scrambled_egg3](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxOkOaKfY7zU7O0pWlxvefA) and [Scrambled Variety](https://www.youtube.com/@ScrambledVariety).
I have made many [Friday Night Funkin'](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin/) mods, which you can find on [my GameBanana page](https://gamebanana.com/members/3914960).

# Someone is bypassing the swear filter!

Create an issue with the word they're using to bypass it.
I will add it to the source code and update the servers.

# Can I modify the code for it?

Sure, just remember to open it in [TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org/) exclusively.
Also, you must give credit to me, as this is my project.
